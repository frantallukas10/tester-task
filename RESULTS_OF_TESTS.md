# Product Management Team Report

## **Objective**

The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the current state of API testing for the
Login and Settings functionalities, including test coverage, results, and identified gaps in the
backend implementation.

---

## **Test Summary**

### **Login Functionality**

- **Active Test Cases:**
  1. Valid Login: Ensures successful authentication with valid credentials.
  2. Invalid Login: Verifies that incorrect credentials are properly rejected.
- **Status:**
  - Valid credentials return the expected token and response.
  - Invalid credentials consistently return **401 Unauthorized** as expected.

### **Settings Functionality**

- **Active Test Cases:**
  1. Update Settings: Verifies successful updates with valid credentials.
  2. Invalid JWT: Ensures rejection of requests with an invalid token.
  3. CSP Headers: Confirms the presence of security headers in responses.
  4. Unauthorized Requests: Ensures proper rejection of requests without authentication.
- **Status:**
  - All active test cases passed as expected.
  - Security headers and proper authentication handling verified.

### **Skipped Test Cases**

Six test cases were skipped due to backend limitations or missing features:

1. Expired JWT Token: Backend does not reject expired tokens.
2. Rate Limiting: Not implemented on the backend.
3. Input Validation:
   - SQL Injection payloads are accepted without rejection.
   - Unexpected fields in payloads are not rejected.
   - Invalid data types are processed without validation.
4. XSS Prevention: Dangerous input is not sanitized or rejected.

## **Key Findings**

### **Strengths**

- Authentication workflow is functional for both valid and invalid credentials.
- Proper security headers are included in API responses to prevent XSS.
- Basic authorization checks (e.g., invalid JWTs, unauthorized requests) are correctly implemented.

### **Weaknesses**

- Lack of rate limiting makes the API susceptible to abuse via brute force or DoS attacks.
- Insufficient input validation allows dangerous payloads to be processed, increasing the risk of:
  - SQL Injection.
  - XSS attacks.
- Backend does not reject expired tokens, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
- Unexpected fields and invalid data types are not validated or rejected, causing potential
  undefined behavior.

---

## **Recommendations**

1. **Implement Rate Limiting:**

   - Limit the number of requests allowed within a specific time frame to prevent abuse.
   - Return **429 Too Many Requests** for exceeded limits.

2. **Enhance Input Validation:**

   - Reject SQL injection payloads and sanitize inputs to prevent database exploitation.
   - Validate all fields for correct data types and reject unexpected fields.

3. **Handle Expired Tokens:**

   - Ensure expired JWT tokens are invalidated and rejected with a **401 Unauthorized** response.

4. **Prevent XSS Attacks:**

   - Sanitize and validate inputs containing HTML or JavaScript to mitigate XSS risks.

5. **Improve Error Handling:**
   - Ensure error responses do not expose sensitive information or stack traces.

---

## **Action Items**

1. **Backend Development Team:**

   - Implement missing rate limiting and input validation mechanisms.
   - Add token expiration handling in the authentication middleware.

2. **QA Team:**

   - Expand test cases to cover newly implemented features once backend fixes are deployed.
   - Develop additional edge case scenarios for input validation.

3. **Security Team:**
   - Conduct a thorough security review of the API endpoints to identify further vulnerabilities.

---

## **Conclusion**

The current state of the API has functional authentication and basic authorization mechanisms in
place. However, critical gaps in input validation, rate limiting, and expired token handling pose
potential security risks. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the robustness and
security of the system.
